# Futurology

I recently saw a video where Hank Green reads a bunch of predictions about 2020, made in 1990.
In video [*In 1990 I Made a Bunch of Predictions About 2020...Here they Are*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX3bAluNsHY),
Hank walks us through some things that happened, such as the first black president,
and others we're still waiting for, such as the first female president.

While I'm not in the business of futurology,
I do like to partake in its light, coffee table equivalent,
which is writing a blog post which no one will ever read.
Unnecessary to say that, none of this post is data-driven,
or maybe some part will (?).

However, I do not wish to try and guess about everything in the future,
but rather discuss programming in general.
