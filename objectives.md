# Objectives

This is a short note on objectives and possible distinctions between them.

## Traditional Objectives

Traditional objectives relate with the project aim,
usually they are the creation of a solution to a problem.

They fit the traditional sense of objective in which that the end goal is clear and achievable.
Examples of these objectives would be milestones.

## Meta Objectives

These objectives transcend the project at hand,
they are related with the skills required to complete a given project,
as well as the ones which while not required could be learned.

For example, picture a developer trying to write a web server,
to complete such project the developer needs only to know how HTTP works and
a high-level overview of the web framework being used.

In this case, the meta objectives can be thought as being:
- Learning HTTP
- Deep dive into HTTP

If the developer only aims to know the first,
using the pre-built framework is enough.
However, if the developer wishes to tackle the second problem,
reinventing the wheel is beneficial, allowing the developer to take a practical deep dive into HTTP.
